# `swe.solve`

`swe.solve` takes a repository URL and a natural-language task and runs a
[mini-swe-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent) loop **inside a
helmdeck session sidecar** to produce a reviewable code change. It is the
single-call orchestrator for the full edit loop: clone the repo, seed the agent
with a symbol map, run the agent, capture the diff and the agent's trajectory,
and — depending on the output `mode` — stop at a patch, push a new branch, or
open a pull request.

The agent runs **local-in-session**: `mini` executes with the sidecar's own
bash inside the clone, and its LLM calls go to helmdeck's OpenAI-compatible AI
gateway via litellm. The resolved git credential and the gateway API key are
**never visible to the agent** — they are injected through the same
`GIT_ASKPASS` / `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` / stdin patterns used by `repo.fetch` and
`repo.push`, and they never appear in the trajectory, the diff, the logs, or
the pack output.

## Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `repo_url` | `string` | yes | — | Git URL to clone. SSH (`git@host:owner/repo`) or HTTPS. |
| `task` | `string` | yes | — | Natural-language task for the agent. |
| `ref` | `string` | no | clone HEAD | Base ref to clone / check out. |
| `base_branch` | `string` | no | `ref` or `main` | PR base branch (`pull_request` mode). |
| `credential` | `string` | no | `github-token` | Vault credential name for HTTPS clone/push and PR auth. |
| `model` | `string` | no | `HELMDECK_SWE_MODEL` or `gpt-4o` | litellm model id for the agent loop. |
| `gateway_base` | `string` | no | `HELMDECK_GATEWAY_BASE` or `http://localhost:8080/v1` | OpenAI-compatible gateway base URL the sidecar reaches. |
| `max_steps` | `number` | no | `30` | Agent step bound (maps to `mini --step-limit`). |
| `mode` | `string` | no | `patch` | `patch` \| `branch` \| `pull_request`. |

## Outputs

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | `boolean` | True when the loop completed and a diff was captured. |
| `summary` | `string` | Best-effort summary from the agent's trajectory. |
| `patch` | `string` | Unified diff of the change (staged working tree vs. cloned HEAD). |
| `commit` | `string` | Commit sha (`branch` / `pull_request` modes). |
| `branch` | `string` | New branch name, `helmdeck/swe-solve-<short-sha>` (`branch` / `pull_request`). |
| `pr_url` | `string` | PR HTML URL (`pull_request` mode). |
| `trajectory_artifact_key` | `string` | Artifact key for the stored trajectory (`application/json`). |
| `steps_executed` | `number` | Best-effort step count from the trajectory. |

The response also includes a top-level `session_id` (the pack is session-coupled
and `PreserveSession`) and an `artifacts` array containing the trajectory.

## Output modes

- **`patch`** (default, safe): clone → seed → agent loop → capture diff +
  trajectory. **No push.** Use this to review the agent's proposed change before
  it touches any remote.
- **`branch`**: everything `patch` does, then create a **new** branch
  (`helmdeck/swe-solve-<short-sha>`), commit the change, and push the branch via
  vault credentials. Does not open a PR.
- **`pull_request`**: everything `branch` does, then open a PR (`head` = the new
  branch, `base` = `base_branch`) via `github.create_pr`. A human reviews and
  merges the PR — the agent's work is **never merged automatically**.

### Never pushes to the default branch

`branch` and `pull_request` modes always create a fresh
`helmdeck/swe-solve-<short-sha>` branch with `git switch -c` (which fails if the
name already exists) and push **that** branch. swe.solve never commits to or
pushes the cloned/default branch. This is a hard invariant, covered by a unit
test.

## Vault credentials needed

- **Git clone/push** — for private HTTPS repos, pass `credential` (default
  `github-token`, type `api_key`). For SSH URLs, an `ssh` credential matching
  the host is resolved automatically. Public HTTPS repos clone with no
  credential.
- **AI gateway** — a credential named `helmdeck-gateway` (type `api_key`,
  override via `HELMDECK_GATEWAY_CRED`) holding the OpenAI-compatible token for
  the gateway. If absent, the agent runs against an auth-optional gateway. The
  key is piped via stdin into the agent run script and exported as
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside the sidecar only.
- **Pull request** — `pull_request` mode reuses the same `credential` PAT for
  `github.create_pr`.

In all cases the credential value is injected via stdin / `GIT_ASKPASS` /
environment-from-file and never reaches the agent argv, the trajectory, the
logs, or the pack output.

## Gateway wiring (operator note)

There is no internal constant for the gateway base URL reachable from inside a
session container, so swe.solve accepts it via the `gateway_base` input and
falls back to `HELMDECK_GATEWAY_BASE`. **Operators must set
`HELMDECK_GATEWAY_BASE`** in the control-plane environment to the in-cluster
control-plane `/v1` URL (e.g. `http://control-plane:8080/v1`) so the sidecar
can reach the gateway. The default `http://localhost:8080/v1` only works when
the sidecar shares the control plane's network namespace.

## Sidecar image

swe.solve pins `ghcr.io/tosin2013/helmdeck-sidecar-mini-swe:latest` (override via
`HELMDECK_SIDECAR_MINI_SWE`), built by `make sidecar-mini-swe-build`. The image
extends the Python sidecar with `mini-swe-agent` (pinned, per ADR 037),
`universal-ctags` (for the repo.map seed), and the vendored
`contrib/helmdeck-environment` adapter. SessionSpec: `MemoryLimit: 2g`,
`Timeout: 20m`.

## Use it from your agent (OpenClaw chat-UI worked example)

> *OpenClaw chat capture pending.*

## Developer reference (`curl`)

`swe.solve` is **async** — `tools/call` (or the REST endpoint) returns a task
envelope; poll for the result. Mint a JWT first:

```bash
ADMIN_PW=$(grep HELMDECK_ADMIN_PASSWORD /root/helmdeck/deploy/compose/.env.local | cut -d= -f2)
JWT=$(curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"${ADMIN_PW}\"}" \
  | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["token"])')
```

Happy path (patch mode):

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/packs/swe.solve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git",
    "task": "Add a top-level CONTRIBUTING.md with a one-paragraph intro.",
    "mode": "patch"
  }'
```

## Error codes

The closed-set codes are defined in
[`internal/packs/errors.go`](https://github.com/tosin2013/helmdeck/blob/main/internal/packs/errors.go):
`invalid_input`, `invalid_output`, `schema_mismatch`, `session_unavailable`,
`handler_failed`, `artifact_failed`, `timeout`, `internal`.

| Code | Triggers |
|---|---|
| `invalid_input` | Missing `repo_url`/`task`; unknown `mode`; refless remote; agent produced no change to commit (branch/PR modes). |
| `session_unavailable` | Engine has no session runtime/executor. |
| `handler_failed` | Clone/mini/commit/push exec failed; vault credential not found; PR creation failed. |
| `schema_mismatch` | Non-fast-forward push rejected. |
| `artifact_failed` | Trajectory artifact store failed. |

## Session chaining

**Required.** The pack acquires its own mini-swe sidecar session and keeps it
alive (`PreserveSession`). The returned `session_id` can be reused by follow-on
`fs.*` / `cmd.run` / `git.*` packs to inspect or extend the clone.

## Auto-trigger from GitHub issues (ADR 033, #233 Phase 6)

`swe.solve` can run automatically when an issue is **labeled** on a connected repo — "label an issue, get a PR." The GitHub webhook receiver (`POST /api/v1/webhooks/github`) verifies the delivery's HMAC-SHA256 signature, then dispatches `swe.solve` on a detached background context (the agent loop takes minutes; it never blocks GitHub's ~10s delivery timeout) and posts the resulting PR + summary back as an issue comment.

Configure it with two env vars on the control plane:

```bash
HELMDECK_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<the secret you set on the GitHub webhook>
HELMDECK_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_RULES='[
  {
    "event":  "issues",
    "action": "labeled",
    "label":  "swe-solve",
    "pack":   "swe.solve",
    "args":   { "mode": "pull_request", "credential": "github-token", "model": "gpt-4o" }
  }
]'
```

- The webhook builds the pack input from the event: `repo_url` = the repo clone URL, `task` = the issue title + body (or the comment body for an `issue_comment` rule). Fields in `args` are merged **over** that, so `mode`/`credential`/`model` are operator-controlled.
- `mode` defaults to `pull_request` for issue events — the headline flow opens a PR.
- The result comment is posted via `github.post_comment` using the same `credential`; omit it and swe.solve still runs, just without the comment-back.
- Point the GitHub webhook at `https://<your-host>/api/v1/webhooks/github` with content-type `application/json` and the same secret, subscribed to the **Issues** event.

Guardrails carry over: the `label` filter means only explicitly-labeled issues trigger a run, and `swe.solve` still never pushes to the default branch.

## Async behavior

**Asynchronous.** `swe.solve` sets `Async: true` — the initial call returns a
SEP-1686 task envelope and the agent loop (up to the 20-minute session budget)
runs in the background. Poll `tasks/get` (or the `pack.status` / `pack.result`
trio) for completion.
